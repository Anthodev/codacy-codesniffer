The opening brace must be on the same line as the keyword and the closing brace must be in the line after the body.
Everything should be properly spaced and indented. Here are some examples:

    for (...) {

    try {
      ...
    } catch (...) {

    do {
      ...
    } while (...)

    if (...) {

    } else if (...) {
