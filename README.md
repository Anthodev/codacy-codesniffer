# Codacy PHP_CodeSniffer

This is the docker engine we use at Codacy to have [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) support.
You can also create a docker to integrate the tool and language of your choice!
See the [codacy-engine-scala-seed](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-engine-scala-seed) repository for more information.

## Usage

You can create the docker by doing:

```bash
docker build -t codacy-codesniffer-base .
sbt docker:publishLocal
```

The docker is ran with the following command:

```bash
docker run -it -v $srcDir:/src  <DOCKER_NAME>:<DOCKER_VERSION>
```

## Test

We use the [codacy-plugins-test](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-plugins-test) to test our external tools integration.
You can follow the instructions there to make sure your tool is working as expected.

## Generating the documentation

Requirements:

- phpdoc

    ```bash
    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    php composer install
    composer global require phpdocumentor/phpdocumentor
    export PATH=$PATH:~/.composer/vendor/bin/
    ```

Update the versions in `composer.json` and run:

```bash
sbt "runMain codacy.codesniffer.docsgen.GeneratorMain"
```

This will create updated `patterns.json`, `description.json` and the individual documentation Markdown files.

## CodeSniffer configuration file

PHP CodeSniffer can be configured by adding a `phpcs.xml` file to the source code.

Currently, the tool supports this configuration file except from one feature - setting installed_paths: `<config name="installed_paths" />`
